# Recap 

The notebooks in this folder contain code to plot and count the number of trans eGenes and eQTLs identified when we run SAIGE-QTL genome-wide for three representative cell types, CD4 NC, B IN, and Plasma.

* trans eGenes & eQTLs counter (across the three cell types)
  * [counter notebook](count_trans_egenes.ipynb): all SNPs at MAF>=10%, p<5e-6
  * [counter notebook genome-wide significance](count_trans_egenes_gw_significance.ipynb): filtered for SNPs at MAF>=10%, **p<5e-8**
