# Data to use for SAIGE-QTL comparison

* Science paper original results, Spearman correlation + Matrix eQTL [1]
* PEER factor paper results, Matrix eQTL [2]
* vQTL paper results, TensorQTL [3]

## Science paper results

* Yazar et al, Science 2022
* 982 individuals
* sub-optimal PEER factors
* Matrix eQTL as well as Spearman correlation
* no proper multiple testing correction, just qvalue

## PEER factor results

* Xue et al, Genome Biology 2023
* 980 individuals
* new improved PEER factors
* Matrix eQTL results
* also only FDR

## vQTL paper

* Xue et al, in preparation
