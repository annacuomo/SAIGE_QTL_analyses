In order to compare SAIGE-QTL to Matrix eQTL (method used in the [original Science publication](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.abf3041)) further, here we want to compare how they perform in terms of identify Mendelian randomisation signals, using [SMR](https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/smr/#Overview).
